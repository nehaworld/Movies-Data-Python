S - Situation

The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of movies to gain insights into the film industry. The dataset contains information about various movies, including their titles, genres, release years, ratings, and more. By analyzing this data, we can identify trends and patterns that can inform decisions about future movie productions or marketing strategies.

T - Task

The task is to use Python to analyze the movie dataset and extract meaningful insights. This includes:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Exploring the distribution of variables
- Identifying relationships between variables

A - Action

To achieve this goal, I took the following actions:

- Data Import and Cleaning: I imported the dataset into Python and cleaned it by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing data normalization.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed EDA to understand the distribution of variables, such as the distribution of movie ratings, genres, and release years.
- Relationship Analysis: I analyzed the relationships between variables, such as the relationship between movie ratings and genres.
- Insight Generation: I generated insights based on the analysis, such as identifying the most popular genres or the average rating of movies in different decades.

R - Result

The results of the analysis were:

- Insights into movie trends: I identified trends in movie ratings, genres, and release years that can inform decisions about future movie productions or marketing strategies.
- Relationships between variables: I identified relationships between variables, such as the relationship between movie ratings and genres, that can help studios and marketers make more informed decisions.
- Recommendations: I provided recommendations for future movie productions or marketing strategies based on the insights gained from the analysis.
